    "Based on time constraints, I broke up the devepment of this project into two phases:\n",
    "* Phase 1: Models were built using the 'compact game results' from past seasons. This data included which team won and the points scored by the winning and losing team.\n",
    "* Phase 2: Models were built using the 'detailed game results' froom past seasons. This included stats such as the number of field goals made, blocks, steals, free throws, etc.\n",

    "For feature set during development, I tested both a Logistic Regression and a Random Forrest Classifier model.\n",

    "I chose these two models to primarily work with because:\n",
    "* The logistic regression is simple, easy to interpret, and at the very least will serve as a performance baseline for more advanced models.\n",
    "* Random Forests have general high performance and robustness, and in particular, are able to utilize a large number of features and determine which are the most relevant to the problem."

    "The Logistic Regression models had the best training scores but I was concerned they may not generalize as well given the highly correlated nature of some of the features. I did try pruning the feature set of some of the highly correlated or similar features and saw some modest improvements. Unfortunately I didn't have a lot of time to explore this before the submission deadline and ultimately decided to see how my submission using the Logistic Regression model would perform using the full feature set.\n",

After the submission deadline, I explored using 'max_depth' to control the model complexity and it appeared to be very effective for limiting over-fitting."

    "# Discussion and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall this competition ended up being much more challenging to solve with machine learning than I expected it to. As I approached development, I expected as I added more features and information to the models, performance would improve, which was certainly not the case. Based on the leaderboard and discussion in the forums, simple models seemed to perform very well this year. FiveThirtyEight also posted an [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-stats-led-our-brackets-astray-this-march-madness-that-doesnt-happen-often/) on how some of the more advanced statistics weren't very predictive this year, which might explain why Phase 2 performance really wasn't any better than just knowing the final scores of games.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, just using the historical win percentages for seed-to-seed match-ups yielded my best score (0.60450) and would've placed 52nd overall out of 930 submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting finding was that the Logistic Regression model ofter performed better on the 'test' set during model training compared to the Random Forest models, however, the Random Forests performed better in the 2022 Tournament almost entirely across the board indicating a better ability to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approaching this competition next year, I think it will be more important to keep the 'score' of the model in perspective. Many of my models produced scores on the test set during training that would've been top 5 in the competition. Given the incredible variability of results in the tournmanent, it might be a better to focus on improving generalization than optimizing the third decimal place of an already very good training score.
